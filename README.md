Hi! I am Amp 👋


## 🌟 About Me
I'm a data analyst passionate about uncovering the fascinating stories hidden within data. My journey revolves around:

🔍 Finding insights from diverse data sources <br>
🛠️ Processing and cleaning data to unlock its potential <br>
📊 Visualizing data to communicate powerful stories <br>

Currently, I work at a Media Agency, where I focus on bridging insights and communication. You can explore my work-related projects [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/54c251db-f262-4ada-b8cc-de34658a4c25).
I am especially interested in Thailand's open data, including [local government budgeting](https://projects.punchup.world/localbudgeting/), [aging society](https://datayolk.net/data/how-do-senior-citizen-live-in-thailand/), [freelancer income](https://datayolk.net/data/analysis-content-writer-freelance-in-thailand-using-data-visualization/) etc. 
The richness of Thai societal dynamics and public data transparency deeply inspires me.
